## Does VR training have a practical application in aeronautical engineering?

The concept behind this application originates from the production of an interactive VR landing gear program for Multimedia Studies in the 2nd year of a BSc course. This generated interest and enquiries into adapting the program into a training application. Safety is paramount for the aerospace industry, as such, formal training requires precision and accuracy, raising the question “Does VR training have a practical application in aeronautical engineering?”.

## Project Description

A virtual reality training program (using a simile model) of Airbus’s A380 main landing gear, where the user can navigate around and interact with the landing gear performing maintenance tasks, as in changing parts, and assembly/disassembly within a simulated workshop environment. The program will be developed using Unity game engine, C#, and Unity’s XR Management Toolkit.
